<p>Landing somewhere between a scholarly publication and an adventurers notebook, the Murmur theme presents your words &amp; photographs in a handsome, agreeable manner. It is well behaved on both mobile &amp; desktop and radically minimal in its footprint. Charged and ready for deployment to Github Pages.</p>

<p>Suitable for shortform, longform, and probably even waveform. It is purpose-built to accomodate photographic content wonderfully and lends itself well to journaling your sojourn.</p>
