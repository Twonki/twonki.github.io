# First Steps of a long journey

This is my first blog entry. I want to thank you for being here with me.

## Content

I am not so sure about this blog, but there are some things which are particularly interesting to me, those are:

- Teaching & Learning CS
- (Functional) Programming
- (Automated) Testing
- DevSecOps & TeamBuilding
- Failures

I'd like to mostly address those and hope that you also might like it.
I probably will post some book-reviews to the topics too.

Most of my posts will be opinionated, but I try to make clear what are facts and what are opinions.

## Coda

I also try to keep this as a safe and clean space for every reader. Sometimes I'll do a bad joke just out of bad habit - just reach out to me and I'll immediately address it.

If I make jokes about someone's programs, programming languages or statements, I still respect the person.
However I do not intent to name someone clear-named ever, except for me, myself and I.
