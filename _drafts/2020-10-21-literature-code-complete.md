Ofcourse, I am not a real book critic, but I thought if I read a lot I might can share a bit about what I consume anyway. 
Also, it helps me to keep track of what I thought would be the most important parts (some kind of mnemonic for myself).

So, here is the first review: Code Complete 2nd Edition, a book that you are likely to see behind some of your professors in zoom calls.

Yes, I have read it from cover to cover. 
And while I like it, a word of warning: *don't do that*.

## The Book

The book is a real chungus with a total of 900 pages. 
However, as it is well structured, a lot of the pages are tables of contents or references to other parts of the book or further reading,
so the actual content is an estimated 700 pages. 
That is still a lot. What is covered by the book? 

The book focusses on the actual practice of *Software Construction*, that is the actual tasks of writing, reading and maintaining code. 
Other activities of the broader field of *Programming*, such as architecture, requirements-engineering and maintenance are touched but not deeply elaborated (given the size of the book, touched still means 20 pages).

Covered: 

- Program Organization (Classes, Methods, Variables, Data)
- (Developer-)Testing
- Debugging
- Quality Metrics and Concerns
- Developer-Efficiency

Touched: 

- Requirements-Engineering & Architecture
- Working as a team
- Integration 
- Communication about Programs 

## Whats really good? 

What surprised me the most was that there are many scientific studies cited, explained and reasoned about. 
This is something I have rarely seen in a book, and what's even stranger is that it doesn't bother the reading flow.
Other books often are only based on their authors opinion and experience (which is also fine), but Code Complete uses a lot of studies 
which is also trust-building towards the authors credibility. I mean, this guy reads a lot of studies? 

Also, often the opinions expressed in other books are either "weak", that is they always begin with *"it depends...","there is no definite answer, but ..."* which really bothers me by now. 
I mean, in the end I want to read a book to see someones opinions and thoughts.
Yes, we all know that there are exceptions, but you can have an opinion without watering it down to be bulletproof. 
Or, other books overdo their opinion, claiming some kind of superiority (Looking at you, Uncle Bob). 
Steve McConnell goes a nice way between the both extremes, having a strong opinion whenever appropriate, and explicitly mentioning exceptions where his opinion does not apply. 
Even if you know a point where he seems wrong, with the thoughtful explanations provided you don't feel like you need to start a war about it. You understand where he was coming from, and you know that what you think to have against it is likely an exception.

The last point is the well structured approach for both the book itself and references. 
While this seems like a no-brainer, I have seen much worse in both partitioning information into chapters but also in managing references.
However, I think you get the most value out of this if you are using a pdf instead of dead-tree-edition.

## Whats bad ? 

The first things that's bad is the size. 
With so much, while being properly *hyperlinked* it is demotivating to just open it up. 
Also, even if you read it fully (like I did), you cannot remember everything covered (like I do).
Maybe it would be better to split it into parts or something like that, but I am not sure where to split it.

Also it comes with a heavy price, which makes it something that you just don't simply get.

Another bad point that stuck out to me was the chapter on performance tuning. 
While most of the recommendations stay high level and vague, the chapter on performance tuning can be summarized as "If you need to do performance tuning, read the docs and ask people who know". Which is a fair advice, but then most of the chapter does not fit in.

## Recommendations 

I think, if you had a proper *mentor*, a senior dev teaching you how to program, how to debug, who applied reasoning and took time to explain why he does what he does, you do not need to read this book. 
A good apprenticeship in programming will cover most of what the book teaches and works for. 
However, the book can help you find the missing spots in your inherited knowledge, for example the person I learned programming from didn't pay too much attention on comments, so I am actively trying to improve on commenting. 
If you are not aware of your personal issues to grow on, then the book is good because it covers how you improve, gives checklists and shows you literally everything there is you could need to know process-wise.
If you do know your weak spots, I'd recommend that you get a book on the specific topic instead. 
For me, *the art of readable code* helped me more on the topic of comments and self-documenting code than *code complete* did.

My other recommendation about the book is that you either get it used, or you get it as a pdf if you can work with pdf's. 
I think with the build-in references using a pdf is maybe the very best you can do, but it's hard to show of a 900 page pdf in zoom behind you. 

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the most important part of the book is that it contains a lot of tips, tricks and checklists, but applying them is up to you. 
The attitude of learning is unfortunately something you can't get from books. 
Or, you don't get it for free.
If you expect to find *knowledge* in the book, don't buy it. This book teaches you how to learn.

## Trivia

I really like that on the cover of code complete 2, there is an edition code complete 1.
