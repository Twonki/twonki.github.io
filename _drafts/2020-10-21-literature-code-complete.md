Ofcourse, I am not a real book critic, but I thought if I read a lot I might can share a bit about what I consume anyway. 
Also, it helps me to keep track of what I thought would be the most important parts (some kind of mnemonic for myself).

So, here is the first review: Code Complete 2nd Edition, a book that you are likely to see behind some of your professors in zoom calls.

Yes, I have read it from cover to cover. 
And while I like it, a word of warning: *don't do that*.

## The Book

The book is a real chungus with a total of 900 pages. 
However, as it is well structured, a lot of the pages are tables of contents or references to other parts of the book or further reading,
so the actual content is an estimated 700 pages. 
That is still a lot. What is covered by the book? 

The book focusses on the actual practice of *Software Construction*, that is the actual tasks of writing, reading and maintaining code. 
Other activities of the broader field of *Programming*, such as architecture, requirements-engineering and maintenance are touched but not deeply elaborated (given the size of the book, touched still means 20 pages).

Covered: 

- Program Organization (Classes, Methods, Variables, Data)
- (Developer-)Testing
- Debugging
- Quality Metrics and Concerns
- Developer-Efficiency

Touched: 

- Requirements-Engineering & Architecture
- Working as a team
- Integration 
- Communication about Programs 

## Whats really good? 

What surprised me the most was that there are many scientific studies cited, explained and reasoned about. 
This is something I have rarely seen in a book, and what's even stranger is that it doesn't bother the reading flow.
Other books often are only based on their authors opinion and experience (which is also fine), but Code Complete uses a lot of studies 
which is also trust-building towards the authors credibility. I mean, this guy reads a lot of studies? 

Also, often the opinions expressed in other books are either "weak", that is they always begin with *"it depends...","there is no definite answer, but ..."* which really bothers me by now. 
I mean, in the end I want to read a book to see someones opinions and thoughts.
Yes, we all know that there are exceptions, but you can have an opinion without watering it down to be bulletproof. 
Or, other books overdo their opinion, claiming some kind of superiority (Looking at you, Uncle Bob). 
Steve McConnell goes a nice way between the both extremes, having a strong opinion whenever appropriate, and explicitly mentioning exceptions where his opinion does not apply. 
Even if you know a point where he seems wrong, with the thoughtful explanations provided you don't feel like you need to start a war about it. You understand where he was coming from, and you know that what you think to have against it is likely an exception.

The last point is the well structured approach for both the book itself and references. 
While this seems like a no-brainer, I have seen much worse in both partitioning information into chapters but also in managing references.
However, I think you get the most value out of this if you are using a pdf instead of dead-tree-edition.

## Whats bad ? 

- Size
- Price
- Chapter on Performance Tuning

## Recommendations 

- if you had a proper coding-mentor (like a senior dev) you will know most of the items covered
- try to get it used
- try to get it as pdf if you can work with pdfs well

## Conclusion

- Improving is up to you
- Maybe: update for newer sources

## Trivia

I really like that on the cover of code complete 2, there is an edition code complete 1.
