My name is Leonhard, I am a german lunatic and teach my computer to do cool tricks.

Lately someone told me to get lost, so I did, and ended up doing a PhD in the Netherlands. 

This is my blog, where I usually talk about all the stuff I break in my free time.

I like

- Testing
- Teams
- Books
- Java
- Haskell

and you.
