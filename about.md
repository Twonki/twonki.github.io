My name is Leonhard, I am a german lunatic and teach my computer to do cool tricks.

This is my blog, where I usually talk about all the stuff I break in my free time.

I like

- Testing
- Teams
- Java
- Haskell 

and you.  

You might want to check out [my very first blog-post](/first-steps/) to see what you can find here.
